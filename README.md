# CryptoTicker.Hardware
CryptoTicker is an information display board that supports over 1500 coin pairs. The pcb consists of 4 individual 1.3" OLED displays controled by an ESP32. These displays can show a coin pair each. The display outputs are shifted using a multiplexor. Updating or changing the infromation on the fly is possible from the localhost webserver that is running on the device. Vertical and Horizontal positionining is possible. There are 4 programable push-buttons located on the back of the device.  
The device can be extendable to support up to 8 displays or with extra multiplexors up to 64 displays.
# Is [coin] supported?
Full list of supported coins can be found at: https://coinmarketcap.com/all/views/all/
# Where is the software?
The software is avalaible on the second repository: https://github.com/BoKKeR/CryptoTicker.Software/
# What is missing
There will be an aditional board that will be powering the CryptoTicker pcb and serving as the USB to serial converter for the EPS32. There are smaller problems with this design. The files will be updated soon.
